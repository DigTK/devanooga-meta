# devanooga Hack Night

devanooga hosts hacknights on a fortnightly basis at [Workhorse](https://gettowork.horse/).

## Activities

Even though we call it _"hack night"_ we do a lot of socializing, we have a meeting room that we can use to work together on a larger project together away from the chit-chat (if we have one) or use the large open room to work on your own stuff if you don't mind getting lost in the various talks we have.

Sometimes we play games like [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://www.bombmanual.com/), we've been discussing bringing more games (board, card, etc.) to future hack nights, so feel free to make recommendations, if we don't have it and there is a lot of interest we may consider picking it up for the group.

## Food

Food is typically provided, check out [food.md](food.md) for details on food options.
